## Mineswepper 
In this project, I built an interactive interface emulating the classic Microsoft Minesweeper using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery; Also, icons were imported from FontAwesome. Check it [here](https://davidandbar.github.io/minesweeper/)!

You can choose between 4 different difficulties: Beginner, Easy, Intermediate, and Expert.
Each cell has a number that tells you how many bombs that cell has in its surroundings. Try to discover all the non-bomb cells.

### Instructions for web
    Left-click: Discover the cell. 
    Right-click Flag/unflag cell.

### Instructions for mobile
    Tap: Discover the cell. 
    Hold a cell: Flag/unflag cell.

## Data Formatter:

### Overview:
The Separator Transformer Tool is a simple, intuitive webpage that allows users to transform their data from one delimiter format to another effortlessly. Whether you're dealing with CSV files, text lists, or any other type of data, this tool makes reformatting quick and seamless.

### How It Works:

- Input Your Data: Paste your data into the input field, regardless of its current separator (e.g., commas, spaces, semicolons, etc.).
- Select Current Separator: Choose the separator currently used in your data from a dropdown menu or by typing it.
- Choose New Separator: Specify the desired separator (e.g., periods, dashes, or custom characters).
- Transform: Click the "convert" button to instantly convert your data into the new format.
- Copy: Easily copy the transformed data.

### Example:

- Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6 (Comma-separated)
- Desired Separator: . (Period)
- Output: 1.2.3.4.5.6

### Features:

- User-friendly interface for quick data transformation.
- Support for custom separators (e.g., tabs, pipes).
- Option to save transformed data for reuse.

### Audience:
This tool is ideal for professionals, students, and developers working with structured data, making data cleaning and formatting tasks more efficient. Open it [here](https://davidandbar.github.io/Formatter/).
