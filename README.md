## Mineswepper 
In this project, I built an interactive interface emulating the classic Microsoft Minesweeper using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery; Also, icons were imported from FontAwesome. Check it [here](https://davidandbar.github.io/minesweeper/)!

You can choose between 4 different difficulties: Beginner, Easy, Intermediate, and Expert.
Each cell has a number that tells you how many bombs that cell has in its surroundings. Try to discover all the non-bomb cells.

### Instructions for web
    Left-click: Discover the cell. 
    Right-click Flag/unflag cell.

### Instructions for mobile
    Tap: Discover the cell. 
    Hold a cell: Flag/unflag cell.

## Data Formatter:

This basic tool makes it easy to convert data separated for a specific separator into a customized separator. Open it [here](https://davidandbar.github.io/Formatter/).
> [!NOTE]
> This project will be updated soon to add styles using Bootstrap and let the user choose any data separator.
